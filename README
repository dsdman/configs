This is a collection of config files that I use for my gentoo linux environment on my PC for things like shell(currently zsh) customization, Xorg configuration vim/neovim customization, etc.

config_files go in ~/.config or home/user/.config directory. Holds ranger and vis config.

dot_files go ~/ or home/user/ directory Contains my xinitrc for the startx/xinit script to work, my zsh shell configuration, and my vi configuration.

etc_files go in /etc Contains my xorg.conf that makes my laptop's nvidia card work as well as settings for libinput to disable mouse acceleration and configure my touchpad to be similar to default synaptic settings present on windows.

suckless_files go with the appropriate program's source code. Contains various "config.h"  C source header files and patch files for the suckless envrionment; includes slstatus (status bar configs). My dwm and st source changes (along with Gentoo ebuilds for them) are now kept seperately on their own repos.

Arch files is where I keep arch specific stuff (pacman mirrors, PKGBUILDs, etc) for when I used to use Arch.
