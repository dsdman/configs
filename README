This is a collection of config files that I use for my arch linux environment
on my PC for things like shell(currently zsh) customization, Xorg configuration
vim/neovim customization, etc.

config_files go in ~/.config or home/user/.config directory
  Holds my neovim configuration

dot_files go ~/ or home/user/ directory
  Contains my xinitrc for the startx/xinit script to work, my zsh shell 
  configuration, and my vim configuration

etc_files go in /etc
  Contains my xorg.conf that makes my laptop's nvidia card work as well as
  settings for libinput to disable mouse acceleration and configure my touchpad
  to be similar to default synaptic settings present on windows

local_files go in ~/.local/share or /home/user/.local/share directory
  Contains the vim plugins that I use on a daily basis
