This is a collection of config files that I use for my arch linux environment
on my PC for things like shell(currently zsh) customization, Xorg configuration
vim/neovim customization, etc.

config_files go in ~/.config or home/user/.config directory
Holds my neovim/vim configuration (works with vim too)

dot_files go ~/ or home/user/ directory
Contains my xinitrc for the startx/xinit script to work, my zsh shell 
configuration, my vi configuration, and my Xresources configuration for urxvt (I don't use this anymore
since I switched to st)

etc_files go in /etc
Contains my xorg.conf that makes my laptop's nvidia card work as well as
settings for libinput to disable mouse acceleration and configure my touchpad
to be similar to default synaptic settings present on windows

suckless_files go with the appropriate program's source code
Contains various "config.h"  C source header files and patch files for the suckless envrionment; at
the moment, it includes dwm (window manager), st (terminal emulator), and
slstatus (status bar config).
