This is a collection of config files that I use for my gentoo linux environment on my PC for things like shell (bash) customization, Xorg configuration vim/neovim customization, etc.

config_files go in ~/.config or home/user/.config directory.

dot_files go ~/ or home/user/ directory Contains my xinitrc for the startx/xinit script to work, my shell configuration, and my vi configuration.

etc_files go in /etc Contains my xorg.conf that makes my laptop's nvidia card work as well as settings for libinput to disable mouse acceleration and configure my touchpad to be similar to default synaptic settings present on windows.

suckless_files contains gentoo ebuilds that will install my versions of st and dwm 

scripts is where I store shell scripts for various tasks (dual monitor config, status bar config, etc).

Arch files is where I keep arch specific stuff (pacman mirrors, PKGBUILDs, etc) for when I used to use Arch.
